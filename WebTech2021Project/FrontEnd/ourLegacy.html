          <p>When you come to Ünye Square, a great plane tree welcomes you. In 1461, when Sultan Mehmet Han was returning from the Trabzon Campaign, he went to Ünye Square with Akşemseddin. There is not even a tree in this huge square. Fatih Sultan Mehmet Han says, "Lala, let's plant a tree here, have a shade when we come," and plants a tiny plane tree with his own hands. The historical plane tree in Cumhuriyet Square is about 556 years old. The circumference of the plane tree is 9 meters, its diameter is 2.5 meters, and its length is 30 meters. One of the body of the plane tree was shattered and burned by a lightning strike in 1950. In Unye, all roads lead to the place where this tree is and this area is known as the Square.</p>

          <p>Ünye Living Cultural Heritage Museum has the characteristics of the 16th Century Classical Ottoman Architecture. It was purchased and restored by the Ünye municipality in 2009. It blends research on Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage with the discipline of Applied Folklore. It makes presentations to visitors by living and experiencing rather than classical museology.</p>

          <p>Yalı Church was built in the second half of the 19th century by the Greeks living in the region for worship. Yalı Church was used by the municipality as a wedding hall and warehouse until recently. Ownership of Yalı Church belongs to Unye Municipality legal entity. In 2013, the project tender was made by the Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism.

          <p>It was made with stones extracted from Ünye by Armenian stone masters in the 1800s. When Süleyman Pasha was building the palace, this bath was built for the use of the palace people and guests, so it is called the Palace Bath.
            <br><br>
            The palace bath ceased to operate in 1960. The restoration of the Palace Bath, tendered by YIKOB, was completed in 2017 and opened for use in its original function.</p>

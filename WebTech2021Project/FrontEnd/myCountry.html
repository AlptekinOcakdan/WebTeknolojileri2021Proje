                    <p> Thanks to the excavation work of Kılıç Kökten, it was understood that Ünye and its surroundings are among the oldest settlements in Anatolia and that the settlement started in prehistoric times. The known history of Unye goes back to the Hittites period. The settlement and its surroundings, which remained within the borders of Rome and Byzantine, remained under the rule of Danişmendli and Anatolian Seljuks. However, no historical remains have been identified within the district boundaries of these periods. Later, while within the borders of Trabzon Empire, Trabzon Emperor II. Ünye Castle was built by Ioannis. </p>

                    <p>Ünye, after the establishment of Trabzon province in 1867, was turned into a district of the Canik sanjak of this province. According to the yearbook, which is the first yearbook of Trabzon province, only male population of Ünye was determined. Accordingly, 10.972 Muslim men, 1.501 Greek men and 1.253 Armenian men lived in Ünye district. The total number of men was 13,726 people. Looking at the population of 1896, it can be concluded that only adult males were identified at that time. In this case, the estimated population of the Ünye district is four times that of the adult male. Based on this, it can be said that the estimated population of Ünye district is 54,904 people. At that time, Fatsa, Bolaman, Karakuş and Niksar were the towns of Ünye district. However, the male population of these sub-districts was determined separately. Apart from the four sub-districts, Ünye district (central sub-district) included 71 villages. According to the provincial yearbook dated 1896, the population of Ünye district was 52,507 people. 7.4 percent of this population (3.905 people) was Greek and 7.2 percent (3.815 people) was Armenians. The Greeks living in Ünye district were affiliated to the Niksar Archbishopric, one of the four archbishops of the Metropolitan of Trabzon.

                        Unye was ruled by the family of Trabzon Governor Haznedarzade Süleyman Pasha from the second Mahmut period until the declaration of the republic. Haznedarzade Süleyman Pasha had Unye built a palace. This flamboyant palace was also painted by French painters. However, as a result of a fire, the palace became unusable. Today, there are homes of family members on the walls of the Palace. </p>

                        Architecture in Ünye can be divided into old and new. The new one has features seen all over the country. Sites, cooperative homes, excessive concreting. Still, it is considered a relatively smooth settlement. It is seen that urbanization has spread to the coastline and the borders of the district have reached 27 km. Apartments rising along the long coastline exhibit a distorted urbanization. The part of the old Unye remaining from the Armenians and Greeks is established in an area that extends from the place known as Yalı today towards Çakırtepe. Old Ünye houses still preserve their existence in this campus, and restoration work has begun in recent years. The old unye architecture bears the traces of the Ottoman and Greek culture on the other hand. While Greek architecture is dominant in the Yalı campus, Ottoman architecture is observed in Kadılar Slope. Two-storey, wooden and stone-dominated buildings in a large courtyard definitely have a roof. The Palace Mosque, located in the heart of the city, was built in 1710 and is still in service. This mosque was worn during the Turkish War of Independence and was restored by the mayor of the time, Tokatlızade Hüseyin Efendi, in 1928 and reopened. It is a tall mosque with an elegant single minaret and does not contain a dome.

                        Hazelnut, which is the lifeblood of the economy, also determines the social life. It is observed that in late July and August, when the hazelnut is harvested, the district center is emptied and people go to the villages. Unye lives its liveliest period before the harvest season. With the influence of the Unye Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences and the Vocational School, which have been opened in recent years, the mobility of social life attracts attention.
